LEVEL-UP



This is a prductivity app named Level-up where you combine productivity and gamification.


Future things to be added:
1)Battle with online friends to see who levels-up more
2)implementation of a database for backend which could not be implemented due to time restriction 
3)automatic gaining of titles when you reach a certain levels
4)Adding custom items which can be used for fun 
5)A stats graph to show amount experience gained per day


Some bugs still to be resolved
1)implementing local storage which could not be implemented due to time constraints 
2)Level bar not visible sometimes


Thank you for the great experience in debugit.
